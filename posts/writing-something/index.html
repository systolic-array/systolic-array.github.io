<p>Writing forces you to really think.  Well, if your inner critic has high standards then yes, it <em>really</em> forces you to think.</p>
<p>So I am writing this so that the rubber hits the road of writing in this format and exploring what to write about.</p>
<p>Some things I enjoy about writing this in Github are that.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is completely free (I really find it superfluous to be paying for a fancy blog, some elaborate journal social network thing, etc.)</li>
<li>Writing in Markdown is very intuitive and is more intimate than the essay style format the closed-source world and mind clings to</li>
<li>GitHub enables me to add intuitive version control to my writing</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things I want to write about</p>
<ul>
<li>I would love to (try my best) to write in different languages because I never really found a meaningfully free way to do so</li>
<li>Write guides to understand topics myself and then share them to others</li>
<li>Ramble about a variety of topics for the fun of it</li>
</ul>
